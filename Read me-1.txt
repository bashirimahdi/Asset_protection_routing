4 instances are provided by considering different number of potential nodes for establishing fire stations . The parameters are generated for 1458 scenarios.  The travel times for these instances are illustrated by Travel time(N-M), N and M define the set of assets and potential nodes for establishing stations, respectively. Therefore the indices i and j are defined in the set {1, 2, ..., M+N} and  table corresponding to parameter Tij(?) includes (M+N)×(M+N) rows and 1458 columns. The travel time parameters in each instance is mentioned by considering one vehicle, therefore, this paramerter for each vehicle is obtained by Tijk(?)=k×Tij(?) in the cases with more than one vehicle in each station.  Also, it's assumed that routing cost (Cijk(?)) is equal to Tijk(?).
